I hope you rot in hell. I have 
hated you since 5th grade yet we 
were never friends. You have abused 
me mentally, verbally, and 
physically. I didnt think this 
would happen. I bet you didnt think 
this would happen either. You would 
never think I would do something 
like this. So you continued to do 
it. Everyday. Every minute. You 
think you are the best thing 
around. You act gangster but you 
live in Novato. You juul,get 
stoned,sneak out, and all without 
punishment. Do your parents know? 
You think you are so cool but you 
are really just a dick. Then you 
laugh it off saying, chill alex, 
god... and make it seem like you 
are the victim. I have nothing else 
to say to you except 
for<br><br><br>
